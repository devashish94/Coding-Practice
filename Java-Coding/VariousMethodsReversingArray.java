 *             > This algorithm runs in linear time because we iterate over the whole array once.
 * 2. swappingMirrorElements(Integer[] arr)
 *            -> Time Complexity = O(n) i.e. linear time
 *           -> Space Complexity = O(1)
 *            > This algorithm reverses the array in actually less than O(n) time complexity because,
 *              we are running the loop only (n / 2) times but in Asymptotic notation it is considered to be O(n)
 *
 * 3. inBuiltFunction(Integer[] arr)
 *           -> Time Complexity = O(n) i.e. linear time
 *           -> Space Complexity = O(1)
 *            > The documentation for this method clearly specifies that this algorithm runs at linear time
 *
 * So the most efficient algorithm is in the swappingMirrorElements() method.
 * This is because the loop in the algorithm runs only n/2 times.
 * So it is actually less than O(n) but in Asymptotic notation it is considered to be O(n).
